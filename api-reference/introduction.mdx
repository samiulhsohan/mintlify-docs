## Base URL

The ProWithdrawals API is designed using **REST** principles, and to ensure the highest level of security, all communication is transmitted over **HTTPS**.

All requests contain the following base URL:

```
https://prowithdrawals.com/api
```

## Authentication

To authenticate your requests, you'll need to provide an API key, which can be obtained from your [ProWithdrawals dashboard](https://prowithdrawals.com/developers).

Include these keys in your request headers under the following keys:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>
```
